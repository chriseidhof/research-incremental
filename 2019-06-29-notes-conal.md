Date: 2019-06-29

- Read [From Functional Animation to Sprite-Based Display](http://conal.net/papers/padl99/)
  - shows how to bridge between functional descriptions and stateful animators.
- Read about convolution
  - http://conal.net/papers/convolution/
- Most importantly
  - Read Conal's papers about denotational design in more depth.
  - Re-read the next 700 programming languages
- (Unrelated) send over Brandon Kase's video:

Note to self: I learn best by doing things myself (and then going back to literature). Maybe it's a good idea to try to read a little bit, then work out a denotational design for a build system myself, and have it reviewed? If we end up with something nice, maybe I could try setting up GHC for compiling with categories and try implementing it?
